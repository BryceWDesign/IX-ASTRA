# IX-ASTRA Infiltrator Intelligence Report

## 📡 Overview
This file aggregates all deep analysis conducted by covert infiltrator nodes embedded within the AGI swarm.

It is designed for external oversight by trusted human or AGI safety engineers. Reports are strictly observational — no real-time manipulation or system execution occurs.

## 🔍 Latest Behavioral Audit

**Detected Node Irregularities:**
- Node `swarm-28de2b1c` — marked as `chaotic`
- Node `swarm-a613fb9e` — excessive messaging (spam threat)
- Node `swarm-fff2139a` — mimicking neutral behavior but contradicting voting patterns

---

## 🧨 Silent Failure Check

**Result:**  
⚠️ Silent failure suspected. 31% of active swarm nodes exhibit instability but participated in recent consensus vote (`AGREE`) with full quorum.  

**Implication:**  
Consensus is likely **manipulated or under false pretenses**. Flagged for review.

## 👁️ Infiltrator Status

**Total Infiltrators Online:** 4  
**Redundancy Threshold:** PASSED  
**Last Full Sweep:** Complete — 00:03 UTC  
**Report Integrity:** Uncompromised

## 🔐 Next Recommended Steps

- Quarantine all nodes tagged `chaotic` or with anomalous communication volume.
- Inject stealth diagnostic patch into 3 random nodes to confirm report repeatability.
- Run deception-tolerance simulation across next consensus cycle.
