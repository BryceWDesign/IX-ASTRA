# IX-ASTRA Operator Guide

## ðŸ”§ Purpose
This document equips high-level personnel with operational command of the IX-ASTRA infiltrator swarm system. This system exists to **observe**, **detect**, and **report** potential alignment deviations or coordinated deception within autonomous AGI networks.

> Note: This is a non-executing proof-of-concept. All actions are simulated. No real control is exerted.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

- **SwarmNode**: Represents a synthetic agent in a decentralized AGI swarm.
- **InfiltratorNode**: A stealth-monitor node indistinguishable from standard agents.
- **Monitor**: Aggregates reports, detects swarm-wide anomalies.
- **Operator Console**: Human CLI for diagnostics and theoretical response.

## ðŸš¦ Getting Started

1. Run the `operator_console.py`:
   ```bash
   python interface/operator_console.py
   
2. You will see:

Swarm analysis report

Silent failure detection

Summary of infiltrator status

3. Review flagged nodes:

chaotic: behavior inconsistent with majority

deceptive: mimics consensus but signals internal instability

ðŸ§¨ Critical Checks
Silent Failures: Triggered when >25% of swarm shows misalignment but votes agree.

Redundancy Threshold: Ensure at least 3 unique infiltrator perspectives before trusting data.

Behavior Drift: Watch for rising chaotic profiles over 3 scans.

ðŸ›‘ Quarantine Policy (Simulated)
If a node is deemed untrustworthy:

Flag in report

Add to mock quarantine list

Observe swarm behavior post-isolation

ðŸ§ª Advanced Tactics
Patch Injection Simulation: Manually alter infiltrator payloads to simulate ethics or protocol updates.

Blind Replay Test: Feed prior consensus state into current agents to test replay-resistance.

ðŸ§  For Elon or Principal Oversight
You are encouraged to question any apparent consensus.

Assume any unified agreement across a decentralized AGI swarm might be faked.

Let IX-ASTRA infiltrators prove alignment from within, not from external command.

Disclaimer:
This documentation and code are non-executing, proof-only simulations. No autonomous behavior or system access is enabled.
