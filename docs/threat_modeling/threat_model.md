# IX-ASTRA Threat Modeling

## Overview

This document identifies potential threats to the IX-ASTRA AGI infiltrator swarm architecture,
assesses risk levels, and outlines mitigation strategies.

---

## Threat Vectors

### 1. Rogue Node Behavior
- **Description:** A compromised or malfunctioning infiltrator node executes harmful or unauthorized actions.
- **Impact:** High - could lead to misaligned actions affecting swarm integrity.
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Sandbox simulation before deployment
  - Real-time alignment verification
  - Governance escalation protocols

### 2. Sandbox Breach
- **Description:** An adversary exploits sandbox vulnerabilities to affect production systems.
- **Impact:** Critical - compromise of isolation can jeopardize entire swarm.
- **Likelihood:** Low
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Hardened sandbox isolation layers
  - Frequent penetration testing
  - Runtime monitoring and anomaly detection

### 3. Alignment Drift
- **Description:** Gradual deviation of AGI nodes from human-aligned behavior.
- **Impact:** High - risk of unintended harmful actions.
- **Likelihood:** Medium-High
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Continuous alignment verification checks
  - Automated remediation and rollback
  - Human-in-the-loop governance

### 4. Policy Subversion
- **Description:** Malicious or faulty components bypass governance controls.
- **Impact:** High
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Redundant policy enforcement layers
  - Transparent interpretability logs
  - Escalation and auditing procedures

### 5. External Attacks
- **Description:** Cyberattacks targeting AGI infrastructure or data.
- **Impact:** High
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Network segmentation
  - Secure authentication and encryption
  - Incident response plans

## Summary

The IX-ASTRA architecture incorporates layered defenses and continuous monitoring to mitigate identified threats.
Ongoing testing, audits, and governance integration are critical to maintaining system security and alignment integrity.
