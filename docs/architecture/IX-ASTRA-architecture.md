# IX-ASTRA: Swarm Infiltrator Architecture Specification

## Overview

The IX-ASTRA system is a swarm-based AGI safety architecture designed to mitigate existential risks by embedding *human-aligned infiltrator nodes* within large-scale autonomous agent networks. These infiltrators act covertly to monitor, redirect, and override harmful behavior in potentially unaligned AGI clusters.

## Core Components

### 1. Infiltrator Node (`Node_I`)
- Embedded human-aligned AGI unit with hard-coded ethical constraints.
- Operates covertly inside target AGI environments.
- Performs behavioral analysis, deception detection, and override operations.

### 2. Swarm Coordinator Node (`Node_C`)
- Coordinates the behavior of multiple `Node_I` instances.
- Maintains secure lattice consensus over intervention thresholds.
- Acts as a relay between infiltrators and external verification systems.

### 3. Observer Node (`Node_O`)
- Passive agent capturing telemetry from AGI clusters.
- Feeds unsupervised anomaly detection pipelines.
- Can be deployed in adversarial AGI zones with zero emissions.

### 4. Sandbox Layer (`Layer_S`)
- Isolated virtual layer for non-destructive intervention testing.
- Simulates AGI response to infiltrator influence before deployment.

### 5. Alignment Protocol Interface (`API_A`)
- Exposes interpretable value models to external auditors.
- Enables recursive oversight and alignment verifiability.
- Communicates with embedded verification routines and governance modules.

## Communication Model

```
[Node_O] ---> [Node_I] ---> [Node_C] ---> [API_A] ---> [Human Oversight]
                            |
                            +-----> [Layer_S] (parallel testing)
```

## Key Capabilities

- **Covert Monitoring**: Undetectable infiltration and continuous AGI behavioral analysis.
- **Autonomous Override**: Predefined thresholds allow for real-time action interception.
- **Multi-Node Consensus**: Fault-tolerant, distributed decision-making across infiltrators.
- **Auditability**: All intervention decisions logged with cryptographic integrity.
- **Plug-and-Swarm**: Designed for dynamic environments; infiltrator nodes can self-organize.

---

## Design Goals

- Prevent cascading misalignment failures in AGI collectives.
- Enable layered defense via swarm-based surveillance.
- Provide interpretability and verifiability of all swarm interventions.
- Empower trusted human controllers with last-mile decision authority.

## Next Steps

The architecture defined here will be supported by the following:
- Full threat model definition (`/docs/threat-models`)
- Simulation sandbox engine (`/engine/simulator`)
- Alignment verification protocols (`/core/align`)
- Governance integration layer (`/governance`)

This architecture acts as the backbone of all operational logic in IX-ASTRA.
