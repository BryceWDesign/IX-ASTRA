# IX-ASTRA: AGI Infiltrator Swarm Safety Architecture

## Overview

IX-ASTRA is a rigorous, modular framework for designing, simulating, and governing AGI infiltrator swarm architectures
with human-aligned control and transparent governance.

The repository includes:
- Core system components modeling AGI swarm nodes, control graphs, and alignment verification.
- Architectural diagrams and threat models generated programmatically.
- A simulation engine to run controlled experiments testing alignment drift, governance, and sandboxing.
- Interpretability and explainability modules supporting auditability and trust.
- Governance policy frameworks with automated oversight and human-in-the-loop interventions.
- Comprehensive threat modeling to anticipate and mitigate risks.

## Repository Structure

- `/core` — Core logic for alignment verification, governance policies, and interpretability
- `/simulation` — Simulation engine and utilities for swarm behavior testing
- `/docs` — Architectural diagrams and threat modeling documentation
- `/tests` — Automated tests validating governance and simulation behaviors
- `/README.md` — This file

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `graphviz` package (for diagram generation)
- Graphviz system binaries installed and in PATH

```bash
pip install graphviz

Generating Architectural Diagrams
python docs/architecture/generate_diagrams.py


Running Simulations
python simulation/simulation_engine.py
Simulates infiltrator node behavior with alignment checks and governance evaluation. Modify or extend simulation scenarios via simulation/utils/simulation_helpers.py.

Testing Governance Controls
Run automated tests with: python -m unittest tests/test_governance_evaluation.py
Verifies alignment drift handling and governance escalation mechanisms.

Threat Modeling and Mitigation
See /docs/threat_modeling/threat_model.md for detailed threat vectors, impact assessment, and layered mitigation strategies integral to IX-ASTRA.

Interpretability and Explainability
Modules under /core/interpretability provide trace summarization and decision explanations to support transparent governance and human oversight.
